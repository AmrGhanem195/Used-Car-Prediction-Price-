Used Car Prediction Price (Regression Model)
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a regression model to predict the price of used cars. The model is trained on a dataset of used car listings and uses various machine learning techniques to learn the relationship between the features of a car and its price.
